This package collects a set of *opinionated* R Markdown templates the
author uses for biological data analysis. Feel free to use, copy, or
fork.

Opinionated features common to all templates include:

- dates based on time-of-render
- floating ToC
- folding code
- pre-written section and sub-section headers
- comment prompts for what questions each section should answer
- reproducibility info in footer (`sessionInfo()` and `conda env export`
  output)

## Installation

The author primarily manages R environments with
[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), so releases go
directly to Anaconda Cloud. To install with Mamba (or Conda), use

``` bash
mamba install merv::r-mervdown
```

For native R installations, one can install from GitHub, either through
\`remotes\`\`

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mfansler/mervdown")
```

or through `BiocManager`

``` r
# install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("mfansler/mervdown")
```

## Usage

After installation, templates are available through RStudio under

> **File \> New File \> R Markdownâ€¦**

then selecting the **From Template** section in the **New R Markdown**
dialog box:

<figure>
<img src="man/figures/new-rmd-dialog.png" style="width:50.0%"
alt="New R Markdown dialog box with mervdown templates" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">New R Markdown dialog box with
<strong>mervdown</strong> templates</figcaption>
</figure>

Alternatively, one can query templates programatically with:

``` r
rmarkdown::available_templates("mervdown")
#> [1] "plyranges" "sce"       "tidyverse"
```

## Forking

Note that Conda recipe code is maintained on the `conda` branch and
includes a GitHub Action for pushing to an Anaconda Cloud account. This
is maintained on a separate branch for modularity and is configured to
launch on recipe changes.

## Feedback

Feedback is welcome through GitHub, but please be aware these templates
are intended for personal use and come with no pretense of developer
support.
